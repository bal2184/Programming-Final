# Programming-Final
Data Anaylsis of Emergency Department Visists
# The aim of your experiment or analysis. 
This project uses a Python script to explore mental health–related emergency department visit rates from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) dataset. The aim of the analysis is to describe patterns in emergency department visit rates over time and to examine how these rates vary across different mental health conditions and demographic groups, including age, sex, and race or ethnicity. The analysis is exploratory and descriptive in nature. This was designed to clean the data, summarize different variables, and visualize different trends in the large public health dataset.
# Instructions on how to run your code.
To run the code, you should first download the file in the repository containing the script and CSV file. The NSSP CSV dataset must be available locally, and the file path in the script should be updated if necessary. In the script, the dataset is loaded using a pandas.read_csv() command, which currently points to a specific file path. If the script is not being run in a cloud environment such as Google Colab, this path should be changed to match the user’s local directory. Once the dataset path is correctly set, the script can be executed from the command line using Python. I ran into troubles getting it to stay in google colab each time I opened it after closing the window. To upload it, go to the left and look for the Folder icon and when you hover over it, it should say "files" then click the little up arrow and it will let you search your storage for the file. 
# Dependencies or packages needed.
A few Python packages are required to run this analysis. The script relies on pandas for data loading and manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scipy for conducting basic statistical tests. These packages must be installed prior to running the script. All analyses and visualizations are produced using standard functions from these libraries.
# Short summary of your results
The results of the analysis are presented through a series of plots that show mental health–related emergency department visit rates across time and across different conditions. Additional visualizations examine differences in rates by age group, sex, and race or ethnicity. The script also includes independent-samples t-tests comparing average visit rates for males and females for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and suspected suicide attempts. In the output generated by the script, these comparisons indicate statistically significant differences, with females showing higher mean visit rates across these conditions. These findings should be interpreted as descriptive summaries of the dataset rather than definitive conclusions, as the analysis collapses data across time and does not control for other factors.
